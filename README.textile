h1. JSONWeb

h2. Basic Idea

* Create a website where the backend simply provides renderable json - i.e. data and some information about how it should be rendered - such as table with class whatever.
* Create libraries suited towards creating markup, not just traversing and altering it.
* Create simple ways for ajax delivery of json to be handled
* Ensure that rendering is done in a fairly manageable and async way so that the page doesn't get smashed by long lists
* Not necessarily intended to support huge sites or lots of data - easy to create a simple, pretty, fast site simply by creating json.
* Sites content is available via an api - preferable restful

h2. Libraries

I want to create some libraries to make this whole thing much cleaner and nicer, I also want them to be seperate from this framework/experiment for easier reuse

* "mcreate":https://github.com/jec006/mcreate - easily create dom elements
* "renderable":https://github.com/jec006/renderable - create a way to render js objects in a simple way
